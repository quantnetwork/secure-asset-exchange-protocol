# Secure Asset Exchange Protocol
This repository contains information relating to a proposed asset exchange modification of IETF's 'Secure Asset Transfer Protocol' standard. We call this proposed protocol, the 'Secure Asset Exchange Protocol' (SAEP). 

The SAEP enables assets on different ledgers to be swapped between users, without transferring those assets off their respective ledgers.

A potential use case of SAEP is to swap central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that reside on different ledgers.
